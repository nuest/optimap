## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Country backfill (`backfill_work_countries`) no longer crashes with `TopologyException` on invalid (e.g. self-intersecting) work geometries — the geometry is now repaired with PostGIS `ST_MakeValid` before the spatial join. Coastal and small-island works within ~12 nautical miles (0.12°) of a simplified country outline now snap to that country instead of returning no match. How each work was joined (`intersects` vs. `buffer_snap`, with the tolerance used) is recorded transparently in `Work.provenance.countries` (issue #261).

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Multi-country support + self-healing country enrichment (issue #261)**: works are now associated with countries through a new many-to-many relation `Work.countries → Country`, replacing the single `Work.country_code` scalar. Association is derived by an **offline point-in-polygon join** against the Natural Earth `Country` outlines (`works.services.countries.countries_for_geometry`), so it is deterministic, needs no network, and is **multi-valued**: a transboundary study links every country its geometry intersects. It is populated both on save (a `post_save` signal gated by `OPTIMAP_GEOCODE_WORKS_ON_SAVE`) and by a **weekly self-healing sweep** (`works.tasks.backfill_work_countries`, scheduled automatically) that links any work with geometry but no countries yet — closing the coverage gap that previously made `/at/<country>/` pages and the `by_country` statistics undercount. The sweep emails active staff a summary only when something changed or errored. Run on demand with `python manage.py backfill_work_countries` (requires `load_countries` to have populated the `Country` table).

### Changed

- **BREAKING (API): `country_code` → `country_codes`**: the Works GeoJSON API (`/api/v1/works/`) and the GeoJSON/GeoPackage/CSV data dumps now expose `country_codes` — a list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes — in place of the single `country_code` string. The schema.org `Place.addressCountry` and the `geo.region` HTML meta tag likewise carry every country a work spans. The `Work.country_code` model field is removed (migration `0031_work_countries`, which preserves existing values by linking them into the new relation before dropping the column). `python manage.py backfill_placenames` now fills only `Work.placename`; country association is handled by `backfill_work_countries`.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Country landing pages (`/at/<country>/`) now draw the country outline on the map**: when the map is shown (i.e. the country's published works have geometry) the country boundary is overlaid. The outline is taken from a new shared, browser-cached copy of the all-countries GeoJSON (`works/static/js/countries-cache.js`, `localStorage`, one-week TTL). The main map's Countries layer (`map-countries.js`) now uses the same loader, so the data is fetched once from `/api/v1/countries/` and reused across the main map and country pages on subsequent visits.

### Fixed

- **`works.0028_country_source_slug` migration no longer crashes on long source names**: the `Source.slug` backfill slugified the (up to 255-character) `Source.name` and wrote it straight into the new `SlugField(max_length=100)`, so any source whose name slugified to more than 100 characters aborted the whole migration with `value too long for type character varying(100)`, blocking deploys. Both the migration backfill and `Source._generate_unique_slug()` now truncate the slug to the field's `max_length`, reserving room for the numeric collision suffix and trimming trailing hyphens. The migration is atomic, so a deploy that hit the old error rolled back cleanly and re-running it after this fix completes.
- **Native (plain) update script is now versioned and self-updating**: the `update-app.sh` body used to be copied out of [docs/deployment-plain.md](docs/deployment-plain.md) into `/opt/optimap/scripts/update-app.sh` by hand, so on-server copies went stale and missed new steps (such as `load_countries`). The script now lives in the repository at [`etc/deploy-plain/update-app.sh`](etc/deploy-plain/update-app.sh) and is symlinked from `/opt/optimap/scripts/update-app.sh` (created by `install.sh`), so `git pull` keeps it current. It runs in two phases — stop services + pull, then re-exec the freshly pulled script (guarded by `OPTIMAP_UPDATE_REEXEC`) for the dependency/migration/restart steps — so an update that changes the update procedure itself takes effect in the same run. Existing servers need a one-time `ln -sfn /opt/optimap/app/etc/deploy-plain/update-app.sh /opt/optimap/scripts/update-app.sh`.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **`reset_harvest_schedules` no longer schedules manual-only (interval-0) sources**: the command rebuilt a `Harvest Source <id>` recurring schedule for *every* `Source`, including those with `harvest_interval_minutes = 0` — contradicting `Source.save()` (which never schedules interval-0 sources) and, since the seeded **"User contributions"** source has interval 0, poisoning the stagger math (`min_interval = 0` → all `next_run`s collapsed to the same instant). It now skips interval-0 sources, so the stagger spreads correctly over the schedulable sources and a database whose only source is manual-only reports "No sources with a harvest interval".
- **Crossref "harvest stopped early" warnings now always reach `HarvestingEvent.log_text`**: the truncation notice was emitted only via `logger.warning`, so it was captured for the event summary only while the logging pipeline was active — if global logging state was altered it could be silently dropped. The two truncation sites now also record the message directly on the `HarvestWarningCollector` (new `add_warning`, deduplicated against the logging handler), guaranteeing it lands in the event log regardless of logging configuration.
- **Data-dump regeneration no longer requires the `ogr2ogr` CLI binary on `PATH`**: the scheduled `regenerate_all_data_dumps` task (GeoPackage + CSV exports) shelled out to `ogr2ogr`, which crashed the whole task on deployments where the binary was missing from the qcluster process's `PATH` (`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ogr2ogr'`). The conversion now uses the in-process GDAL Python bindings (`osgeo.gdal.VectorTranslate`, already a hard dependency via GeoDjango); a genuinely missing/broken GDAL now degrades gracefully (GeoJSON still produced, GPKG/CSV skipped with a warning) instead of failing the task.
- **OpenAIRE enrichment tasks no longer hit the 600-second Django-Q timeout**: the post-harvest OpenAIRE sweep (`enrich_event_from_openaire`) and the `enrich_openaire --async` backfill (`enrich_openaire_backfill`) sleep `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_ENRICH_THROTTLE` seconds between requests (60s anonymously), so a run over more than a handful of DOIs ran past the global `Q_CLUSTER['timeout']` and was killed with `TimeoutException: Task exceeded maximum timeout value (600 seconds)`. Both enqueue sites now pass per-task `q_options` (new `works.harvesting.openaire.openaire_task_q_options`) that raise the per-task `timeout` (and a matching `retry` above it, so Django-Q doesn't re-queue the still-running task) to `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_ENRICH_TASK_TIMEOUT` — default **24h**, configurable, set to `0` to keep the cluster default.

### Added

- **Faceted permalink pages and source landing pages** (#29, #253): new short, SEO-friendly URLs that each render a filtered list of published works — `/at/<place>/` (continent, ocean, or country), `/during/<year>/`, `/on/<topic>/`, and `/in/<source>/`. A new `/browse/` directory lists every facet with counts (linked from the footer and `/pages/`). `/in/<source>/` is the **source landing page**: it combines the work list with a coverage panel fed by the weekly `SourceCoverageSnapshot` (coverage %, with-geometry / with-temporal / open-access rates, contributor count, a per-year bar chart) and the OAI/Crossref/OpenAlex known totals from `Source.statistics`, plus per-source **GeoRSS/Atom feeds** (`/api/v1/feeds/source-<slug>.rss|.atom`, new `SourceGeoFeed`). Year pages match by **data coverage** (`Work.timeperiod_*` temporal extent), not publication date. New `Source.slug` (auto-generated from the name, editable in the admin), `Country` model with simplified Natural Earth outlines + continent (`python manage.py load_countries`), a toggleable **Countries** layer on the main and collection maps (`/api/v1/countries/`), new sitemaps for all four facet families and source feeds, and `landing_page_url` / `feed_georss_url` / `feed_atom_url` on the Source API. Backfilling missing `Work.country_code` (which drives `/at/<country>/`) is tracked separately in [#261](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/optimap/issues/261).
- **Index/overview pages and navigation for the new facets**: `/countries/` lists every country grouped by continent (each continent header links to its landing page, countries with no works yet are shown but not clickable, and a "Sources & licenses for country data" section mirrors the regions page), `/in/` lists all journals/sources, and `/at/` is an umbrella places index (continents + oceans, pointing to `/countries/` rather than duplicating it). All are in the burger menu, the `/pages/` sitemap, and the XML sitemap. The `/regions/` and `/countries/` pages cross-link with buttons, the `/works/` page gained a row of facet-exploration buttons, and the `/statistics/` page now links each **country** (by ISO code) to its `/at/<country>/` page and each **journal / source** to its `/in/<source>/` page. An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 shortcode (e.g. `/at/DE`) 301-redirects to the canonical country-name slug (`/at/germany`); when a name is both a country and a continent (Australia), the country view wins so its work count is consistent.
- **Maps on the source and place landing pages**: `/in/<source>/` and `/at/<place>/` now show an interactive Leaflet map above the work list with the same **"show only page" / "show all"** scope toggle (and current-page highlighting) as the collection pages. The map markup, scripts, and context are factored into shared partials (`partials/works_map.html`, `partials/works_map_scripts.html`) and `works.utils.geojson.build_works_map_context` to avoid duplication.
- **Finer country geometries**: country outlines now come from Natural Earth **1:50m** (was 1:110m) with lighter simplification (`OPTIMAP_COUNTRY_SIMPLIFICATION_TOLERANCE` default `0.01`, was `0.05`), so borders align with the basemap; the `Country` model gained a `continent` field. The `/api/v1/countries/` payload is ≈ 1.6 MB (fetched lazily only when the off-by-default Countries overlay is toggled).
- **Automatic cross-source deduplication via OpenAlex locations**: OPTIMAP now captures every hosting copy of a work that OpenAlex knows about (journal version, preprint, repository copies) into a new `Work.locations` JSON field — produced by the single normaliser `works.harvesting.openalex_locations.build_locations` and credited per entry to OpenAlex (CC0). Works that share an OpenAlex id are **automatically merged** (no human review, `works/dedup.py`): the OpenAlex `primary_location` version becomes the canonical OPTIMAP work, the others become `status='r'` redirect tombstones recorded in `provenance.dedup` / `provenance.redirect`. Merging is lossless for spatial/temporal extents (the canonical's is kept; a non-primary's fills an empty one; conflicts are recorded under `provenance.dedup_conflict`). Every known identifier of a work — each version's DOI, the OpenAlex id, external ids (pmid/pmcid/mag), and OpenAlex location landing URLs — resolves to the canonical work and **302-redirects** to it on the landing page and the API detail endpoint; the landing page lists all copies under "Also available at". Merging triggers automatically at harvest time and in the contribute-by-DOI flow (adding a preprint DOI links it to an existing article), and a new `python manage.py dedup_works` command (sync, `--async` via `works.tasks.dedup_sweep`, `--locations-only`, `--source`, `--limit`, `--dry-run`) backfills `locations` on **all** existing works with an OpenAlex id and merges pre-existing duplicates. Disable auto-merging with `OPTIMAP_DEDUP_AUTO_MERGE=False` (locations are still captured/exposed). The API `WorkSerializer` exposes `locations`; redirected works are excluded from list/feed/map output. Merges are reversible: filter the Work admin by status **Redirected** and run the **"Un-merge (re-promote redirected duplicates)"** action (or `works.dedup.unmerge` in a shell). The `dedup_works` command reports per-work and per-group progress.
- **`harvest_sources --async` now prints the matching HarvestingEvent id**: previously the async route only printed Django-Q's internal task UUID, which never appears on any model the Django admin shows, so a queued harvest couldn't be matched to its event row. The command now pre-creates the `HarvestingEvent` (status `pending`) before enqueuing, prints `HarvestingEvent #<id>` (and the admin URL) alongside the task id, and passes that id to the task — which reuses the row (new `works.harvesting.common.start_harvesting_event` helper) instead of creating its own. Operators can open `/admin/works/harvestingevent/<id>/` straight from the log to watch the harvest progress. All `harvest_*` task entry points gained an optional `event_id` parameter; recurring schedules, the admin "Trigger harvesting" action, and the synchronous CLI path are unchanged (they pass no `event_id` and create the event as before).
- **`--async` flag for `enrich_openaire`**: the OpenAIRE backfill command can now enqueue the whole run as a single Django-Q task (`async_task` against the new `works.tasks.enrich_openaire_backfill`) instead of blocking the terminal for a long, rate-limited backfill. It prints the enqueued task id **and its humanized admin name** (so the task can be located in the Django admin under Django Q → Queued tasks while it waits and then Successful/Failed tasks, whose searchable *Name* column shows the humanized name, not the raw UUID) and returns immediately; progress and the summary land in the Q worker log / task result. Requires a running `qcluster`. The selection + enrichment loop was extracted into the reusable `enrich_openaire_backfill()` task so the synchronous path is unchanged (it calls the same function directly, passing `self.stdout.write` for per-work output).
- **`--full` / `--since` flags for `harvest_sources`** (Crossref-prefix sources): by default a Crossref harvest is incremental — after the first successful run it only asks Crossref for records re-indexed since the last completed harvest (watermark − 2 days), which is why re-running a recently-harvested source returns very few records. `--full` forces a complete backfill (ignores prior `HarvestingEvent`s and re-walks the whole slice) without having to delete events by hand; `--since YYYY-MM-DD` sets an explicit `from-update-date` window. The two are mutually exclusive, validated up front, and apply only to `crossref-prefix` sources (under `--async` they error for sources that can't honor them rather than silently dropping). Threaded through to `works.harvesting.crossref.harvest_crossref_prefix` (new `full` / `since` parameters).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Contribute a new work by DOI**: the `/contribute/` page has a new collapsible "Add a work by DOI" form. A logged-in user pastes a DOI or DOI URL, which is validated client-side (regex helper in `static/js/doi-validate.js`, mirroring the new server-side `works.utils.identifiers.normalize_doi`) before the submit button activates. On submit the new authenticated endpoint **`POST /api/v1/works/contribute-doi/`** either (a) redirects the user to an existing work when the DOI is already in OPTIMAP (`200 exists`, case-insensitive match), or (b) harvests the single DOI from Crossref and runs OpenAlex + OpenAIRE enrichment **synchronously** (`harvest_crossref_doi`), attaches the new work to a dedicated **"User contributions"** source/collection, records a `doi_contribution` provenance event plus a recognition-board `Contribution` row (new `doi` kind), and returns `201 created` with the new work's URL. The endpoint is per-user rate-limited (`OPTIMAP_CONTRIBUTE_DOI_RATE`, default `30/hour`). The recognition board shows a per-contributor "submitted by DOI" count, and the statistics page tracks the cumulative number of DOI-submitted works over time (new `StatisticsSnapshot.contributed_dois`).
- **`--async` flag for `harvest_sources`**: the management command can now enqueue each harvest as a Django-Q task (`async_task` against the same `works.tasks.harvest_*` dotted paths the recurring schedules use) instead of running it synchronously. It prints the enqueued task id per source and returns immediately; the per-source statistics summary is skipped because results land asynchronously (watch the `HarvestingEvent` rows / harvest-completion emails / `qmonitor`). Requires a running `qcluster`. As a safety guard the async path validates, before enqueuing anything, that every harvest-affecting option the operator set maps to an argument the chosen task actually accepts — passing a crossref-only option such as `--source-title`/`--no-publisher-abstract` to a non-Crossref source stops the command with an error instead of silently dropping it (the synchronous path's existing lax behavior is unchanged).

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **ESS Open Archive (ESSOAr) as a harvesting source, with its own published collection** ([#99](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/optimap/issues/99)): AGU's [Earth and Space Science Open Archive](https://essopenarchive.org/) is now harvested via Crossref (it exposes no usable native API — the Atypon/Cloudflare platform blocks OAI-PMH, REST, RSS and even its sitemap). ESSOAr is tricky: its content spans **two DOI eras** — `10.1002/essoar.*` (2018–2022, original platform) and `10.22541/essoar.*` (2022–present, Authorea) — so no single DOI prefix covers it, and both eras share Wiley's Crossref member id (311) and work type (`posted-content`) with Authorea, which Crossref exposes no field to separate. The reliable discriminator across both eras is the DOI slug `essoar`. To support this, the `crossref-prefix` harvester gained three capabilities: a new **`Source.crossref_filter`** field — raw Crossref filter clauses used as the base query instead of `prefix:` (ESSOAr uses `member:311,type:posted-content`, the ~94k-record slice that jointly contains both eras); a new **`Source.doi_contains`** field — a case-insensitive DOI-substring include-filter applied client-side that narrows that slice to `essoar` only; and **incremental harvesting** via Crossref's `from-update-date`, so scheduled runs only fetch records re-indexed since the last successful harvest (watermark = previous completed `HarvestingEvent` date − 2 days) instead of re-walking the whole slice every cycle. Crossref-prefix harvests now also always page with a deterministic `sort=indexed` order, since Crossref's default relevance ordering is unstable under deep cursor paging and can silently truncate a long backfill. The new `essoar` entry in `harvest_sources` (`python manage.py harvest_sources --create-sources --source essoar`) creates the source and the published **"ESS Open Archive"** collection; works are labelled as preprints (`default_work_type="preprint"`, `is_preprint=True`) and abstracts come from Crossref JATS plus the async OpenAIRE enrichment sweep. The `SourceAdmin` form now groups the Crossref-specific fields (`doi_prefix`, `crossref_filter`, `doi_contains`, `source_titles`) in a dedicated "Crossref harvesting" fieldset.
- **OpenAlex enrichment in the Crossref harvester**: the `crossref-prefix` harvest path now runs inline OpenAlex DOI-matching (`build_openalex_fields`) per work — the same enrichment the OAI/RSS/MaRESS harvesters already did — so Crossref-harvested works (Copernicus, Scientific Data, AGILE-GISS, ESSOAr, …) gain research `topics` (OpenAlex-only) and the `openalex_*` identity fields, and have empty authors/keywords/biblio filled. Conflict policy is fill-if-empty: Crossref-supplied authors and biblio (volume/issue/pages) win, and the source's `default_work_type` is kept rather than OpenAlex's type; failures never abort a harvest. Combined with the existing async OpenAIRE sweep, a freshly harvested Crossref work now carries its full set of external identifiers (DOI + OpenAlex + OpenAIRE).
- **"View in OpenAIRE" link on the work landing page**, mirroring the existing "View in OpenAlex" link. When OpenAIRE enrichment matches a work, it now records the public OpenAIRE Explore URL in `Work.provenance.openaire_match.url`; the landing page exposes it via the new `Work.openaire_url` property.
- **External identifier links in the page head**: the work landing page now emits the work's external identifier URLs (DOI, OpenAlex, OpenAIRE, Wikidata) both as schema.org JSON-LD `sameAs` relationships (OpenAIRE is new here; OpenAlex/DOI/Wikidata were already present) and as HTML `<link rel="alternate">` tags. Both are built from a single source (`works.seo.external_identifier_links`) so they stay in sync.
- **OpenAIRE consultation is now always recorded (audit trail)**: the post-harvest enrichment sweep (`works.harvesting.openaire.enrich_event_from_openaire`) now looks up **every** DOI-bearing work in a harvest event, not only those missing a field. Works that already have an abstract/keywords/authors still get an `openaire_match` record (and, on a match, an `openaire_enrich` event listing the offered-but-not-applied fields), so it is always visible in the provenance whether OpenAIRE was checked and what it offered. The `enrich_openaire` backfill command deliberately keeps its missing-field filter — this fuller audit trail is built going forward, not retroactively.

### Fixed

- **OpenAIRE abstracts no longer leak JATS markup**: OpenAIRE returns abstracts wrapped in JATS tags (`<jats:p>…</jats:p>`, `<jats:italic>`, …). Enrichment now strips XML/HTML tags and unescapes entities before storing, so `Work.abstract` holds plain text.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Keywords and topics are now shown on the work landing page, and metadata items carry icons**: the work landing page (`/work/<id>/`) now displays a visible **Keywords** and **Topics** line (next to the Collections line, above the abstract) listing `Work.keywords` (🏷️ `fa-tags`) and `Work.topics` (💡 `fa-lightbulb`) — previously these were only emitted in the page `<head>` (`<meta name="keywords">` and the schema.org JSON-LD), so OpenAIRE/OpenAlex-enriched keywords and topics were invisible to readers. The inline metadata line above it also gained small leading icons for consistency with the existing Collections icon: Authors (`fa-users`), Placename (`fa-map-marker-alt`), Region (`fa-globe`), DOI (`fa-fingerprint`), Published (`fa-calendar-alt`), Source (`fa-newspaper`), OpenAlex (`fa-atom`), and Wikidata (`fa-database`).

- **OpenAIRE refresh-token workflow (rotate the API token without SSH)**: the OpenAIRE Graph API can now be authenticated with a [refresh token](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/authentication/) stored in the database and editable in the Django admin, instead of (or in addition to) the static `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_TOKEN` env var. A new generic **`ServiceToken`** model (one row per external service, keyed by `service`) holds the refresh token plus a cached short-lived access token; `works.harvesting.openaire.get_openaire_access_token` exchanges the refresh token for a ~1h access token (`GET …/getAccessToken?refreshToken=…`) and caches it, and `_openaire_session()` now resolves its bearer token in the order DB access token → static `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_TOKEN` → anonymous. Because OpenAIRE refresh tokens expire after one month, a weekly Django-Q task (`works.tasks.check_service_token_renewals`) checks every stored token and, when one expires within the next 9 days (`OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_RENEWAL_REMINDER_DAYS`), emails active staff a link to the docs and step-by-step renewal instructions (otherwise it just logs its run); the task, the `service_token_renewal` email template, and the supporting `works/utils/service_tokens.py` registry are **generic over a list of services** (OpenAIRE is currently the only entry). Staff renew by pasting a new refresh token on the `ServiceToken` admin page and can verify it immediately with the **"Refresh access token now"** admin action. New settings: `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_REFRESH_TOKEN_DAYS` (default 30), `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` (default 3600), `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_RENEWAL_REMINDER_DAYS` (default 9). See [docs/manage.md](docs/manage.md) → "Renewing the OpenAIRE refresh token".

- **OpenAIRE metadata enrichment (second enrichment source besides OpenAlex)**: works are now enriched from the [OpenAIRE Graph API](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/) — primarily to recover abstracts that the harvest origin does not supply (notably the AGILE Springer LNCS chapters, DOI prefix `10.1007/978-…`, for which Crossref has no abstract). Enrichment runs automatically as an **async post-harvest sweep** for **all sources/collections**: after each successful harvest, `complete_harvest` enqueues `works.harvesting.openaire.enrich_event_from_openaire`, which looks up each of that event's works (by DOI, via `?pid=<doi>`) that are missing an abstract/keywords/authors and fills the empty fields. A new `python manage.py enrich_openaire` command backfills already-harvested works (`--collection`, `--doi-prefix`, `--source`, `--limit`, `--throttle`, `--force`, `--dry-run`). Conflict policy is **fill-if-empty**: enrichment never overwrites an existing non-empty value (precedence `original_source`/`crossref` > `openalex`/`openaire`), and every decision is recorded in `Work.provenance` — `metadata_sources` gains the value `openaire`, a new `openaire_enrich` event lists `fields_filled` and `fields_offered_not_applied` (offers rejected because a value already existed), and an `openaire_match` block records whether OpenAIRE matched. A re-harvest no longer wipes an enriched `abstract`/`keywords`/`authors` when the source brings nothing for them. Configurable via `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_TOKEN` (raises the OpenAIRE rate limit from 60 to 7200 requests/hour — recommended), `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_ENRICH_ON_HARVEST` (default True), `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_ENRICH_THROTTLE`, and `OPTIMAP_OPENAIRE_HTTP_TIMEOUT`. OpenAIRE metadata is CC-BY; OpenAIRE is credited as a data source.

- **"Show on map" button on work cards**: each work card on the collection page (`/collections/<identifier>/`) and the regional feed pages (`/feeds/...`) now has a light-grey **"Show on map"** button next to the primary "View work's page" button (which keeps two-thirds of the row; the new button takes the remaining third). Clicking it flies the map above the list to that work's geometry, scrolls the map into view, and opens its popup with the geometry highlighted — no need to leave the page for the work's landing page. The button only appears where a map is shown above the list (it is absent on the plain `/works/` list) and, on the collection page, only for works that actually have a spatial extent. Shared between both templates via the `_show_on_map_button.html` partial and the `js/map-locate-card.js` module (`MapLocateCardManager`).

- **Schedule a data dump regeneration from the `/data` page**: staff users now see an "Admin view" section on the public Data & API page with a **"Schedule one-time generation of data dumps now"** button. It enqueues the existing `works.tasks.regenerate_all_data_dumps` Django-Q task (the same one used by the scheduled job and the Work admin action) so the GeoJSON/GeoPackage/CSV dumps can be refreshed on demand without touching the admin. The new dumps appear on the page once the background worker finishes.

### Fixed

- **Monthly/weekly email-digest schedules never ran**: `schedule_monthly_email_task`, `schedule_subscription_email_task`, and `schedule_weekly_subscription_email_task` registered Django-Q schedules under the stale `publications.tasks.*` dotted path (the app is `works`), so the cluster could never import them. They now register under `works.tasks.*`. Two further latent bugs were fixed so the tasks actually execute: the function arguments were passed as `kwargs={...}` (which django-q interprets as a single task kwarg literally named `kwargs`) and are now spread correctly, and the weekly digest used a cron schedule (`schedule_type="C"`) that requires the optional `croniter` dependency — it now uses Django-Q's native weekly type (`"W"`, Mondays 02:00). Long-lived deployments may still carry orphaned `publications.tasks.*` schedule rows; clear them once with the one-off command documented in [docs/manage.md](docs/manage.md) → "Operate the Django-Q cluster".

- **Bootstrap tooltips threw `Popper is not a constructor` on hover**: the vendored `js/popper.min.js` was Popper **v2** (`@popperjs/core@2`), but Bootstrap 4.4.1 calls `new Popper(...)` and is only compatible with Popper **v1.x** (the `popper.js` package). Any tooltip — including the two info icons already on the `/statistics` page — threw `Uncaught TypeError: … is not a constructor` the moment it was shown. The library is pinned back to `popper.js@1.16.1` (the version Bootstrap 4 expects), and `works/static/download_libraries.sh` / `works/static/README.md` now document not to upgrade it to Popper v2 unless Bootstrap is upgraded to v5. Re-run `works/static/download_libraries.sh` (or `wget https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1.16.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js -O works/static/js/popper.min.js`) and `collectstatic` to deploy the corrected file.

- **Admin-routed emails linked to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/...` in production**: `BASE_URL` was assigned twice in `optimap/settings.py`, and the second assignment read the unprefixed `BASE_URL` environment variable (which deployments do not set — they set `OPTIMAP_BASE_URL`), clobbering the correct value and falling back to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Magic-link emails were unaffected because they build URLs from the live request, but task-sent emails (contribution-to-review, curator-change, etc.) used `settings.BASE_URL` and got the wrong host. The duplicate assignment is removed; `OPTIMAP_BASE_URL` is now the single source of truth, matching `etc/pygeoapi-config.yml` and the deploy env examples.

- **Admin/curator notification emails now respect account state and the opt-out uniformly**: contribution-to-review, curator-change, and new-user-registration emails are now sent only to **active** accounts (`is_active=True`) — a deactivated staff/curator account no longer receives operational notifications — and all three uniformly honor the `UserProfile.notify_work_events` opt-out (previously only contribution-to-review did; curator-change and new-user emails ignored it). All active, opted-in staff receive these emails.

- **Silenced benign GDAL `StringList` warnings during GeoPackage data-dump generation**: every `regenerate_all_data_dumps` run logged five `Warning 1: The output driver does not seem to natively support StringList type for field … Converting it to String(JSON) instead` messages (for `authors`, `keywords`, `topics`, `bok_concepts`, `collections`). These were pure log noise — ogr2ogr already wrote the GeoPackage correctly. The GPKG conversion now pins the conversion explicitly via `-mapFieldType StringList=String(JSON)`, so GDAL no longer warns; the GPKG output (clean JSON arrays in `String(JSON)` columns) is unchanged.

- **Contributing a simplified geometry no longer fails with a 500 error**: simplifying a suggested boundary that contains small interior holes (e.g. the NER suggestion for "Switzerland", whose Nominatim boundary carries the Büsingen and Campione enclaves as holes) could collapse those holes to a 2-point ring, which GEOS rejects (`Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 2`). Two fixes: (1) client-side simplification is now ring-aware — it keeps a ring's original geometry when simplification would make the exterior invalid and drops interior holes that collapse, so the preview, vertex/size counters, and submitted geometry stay valid and consistent; (2) the `contribute-geometry` endpoint now sanitizes incoming GeoJSON, dropping degenerate rings before constructing the geometry. Salvaged contributions succeed and the user is shown a warning that invalid parts were removed; a geometry with no valid part left now returns a clean `400` instead of a `500`. Because keeping the original outline means a too-strong tolerance can leave the geometry unchanged (e.g. "Medium"/"Aggressive" on a small boundary like Paris), the simplification panel now communicates this: preset buttons that would have no effect are disabled with an explanatory tooltip, and the slider shows a warning when the chosen tolerance removes no points or would collapse the outline.

### Changed

- **Scheduled tasks no longer pile up after the Django-Q cluster is down/blocked**: the cluster now runs with `catch_up: False` (`Q_CLUSTER`, configurable via `OPTIMAP_SCHEDULER_CATCH_UP`). Previously, when the cluster was unavailable, Django-Q's default "catch-up" behaviour replayed *every* missed interval/cron slot on restart, so a recurring task (e.g. a per-source harvest, or the data-dump regeneration) could be enqueued and executed many times back-to-back. With catch-up disabled, each recurring schedule advances to its next future run and fires **once**. Manual triggers are unaffected: ad-hoc `async_task` calls (admin "Trigger harvesting", "Schedule data dump regeneration now", "Calculate statistics now", harvest retries), the admin one-off "Manual Harvest Source" `ONCE` schedule, and `manage.py harvest_sources` never go through the missed-slot replay path. The catch-up is **logged**: all recurring schedules now carry `intended_date_kwarg="scheduled_for"`, and a run that starts more than `OPTIMAP_SCHEDULED_TASK_CATCHUP_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` (default 5) after its intended time emits a WARNING noting that intervening missed runs were skipped (`works/utils/scheduling.py::log_scheduled_catchup`). Django-Q's own scheduler logs are now surfaced too (the `django-q` logger is configured in `LOGGING`).

- **Collection page "Curators" box is now a "Curation" box, and curators can publish works**: the card on `/collections/<identifier>/` is renamed **Curation** and gains a **Review & publish** section above the curator-management UI. The two bulk-publish buttons ("Publish all N unpublished works" and "Publish N with extent") move here from the staff-only admin banner and are now usable by **curators** of the collection, not just staff — `POST /collections/<id>/publish-works/` checks collection curatorship instead of `is_staff` (publishing/unpublishing the *whole collection* stays admin-only and remains in the admin banner). A new **"Show N works ready to publish"** filter link (`?filter=publishable-extent`) narrows the work list to exactly the works the "Publish N with extent" button acts on (Harvested/Contributed with a spatial or temporal extent), with a "show all works" toggle to clear it; the collection's total work count is unaffected by the filter.

- **AGILE collection renamed "AGILE GIS" → "AGILE GI"**: the curated collection is renamed (display name "AGILE GI", identifier/slug `agile-gi`, canonical URL `/collections/agile-gi/`) to match the conference's branding. Both `SOURCE_CONFIG` `collection_name` values now read `"AGILE GI"`, and the Springer source key was renamed `agile-gis-lncs` → `agile-gi-lncs` for consistency (the Copernicus `agile-giss` key is unchanged — it abbreviates "GIScience Series"). Both keys still share the `agile-gi` prefix, so `--source-prefix agile-gi` harvests both streams in one run. Existing work membership is preserved (the `Work.collections` M2M is keyed by primary key, not slug); operators must rename the `Collection` row in place (`identifier`, `name`) on each deployment. The old `/collections/agile-gis/` URL (and its feeds/downloads) returns 404 after the rename; `short_slug` is intentionally left unset so the identifier is the only URL.

- **Statistics "Calculate now" is now a background job** instead of a synchronous computation. The staff button on the `/statistics` page now POSTs to a new endpoint `POST /api/v1/statistics/recompute/`, which enqueues the `works.tasks.recompute_statistics_snapshot` Django-Q task and returns `202 Accepted` immediately; the refreshed numbers appear after the worker finishes. This keeps the request responsive as statistics computation grows in complexity and matches the data-dump button's approach. The legacy synchronous `GET /api/v1/statistics/?now` trigger is removed — that endpoint is now read-only.

- **Finer geometry simplification on the work landing page**: the "Simplify geometry" slider now reaches a smallest tolerance of `0.0001°` (≈ 10 m at the equator) — two orders of magnitude below the previous `0.01°` minimum — for fine adjustments of small or detailed polygons. Two presets, **Minimal (~10 m)** and **Fine (~100 m)**, were added alongside the existing Light/Medium/Aggressive buttons, and the (i) info text now explains that the tolerance is a Ramer-Douglas-Peucker distance in degrees and that the metre estimates on the buttons reflect the impact at the equator (1° ≈ 111 km, smaller at higher latitudes).

- **Consistent hover tooltips across the app**: the Popper.js-backed Bootstrap tooltip already used on the statistics page is now initialized globally in `base.html`, so any element with `data-toggle="tooltip"` gets a styled, instantly-appearing, properly-wrapped tooltip instead of the slow, truncated native browser one. Explanatory text that was previously hidden in plain `title` attributes is now opted in on the **collection page** (source-stats abbreviations, status badges, map-scope and action buttons), **work landing pages** (placename/region info icons, BoK concept chips with truncated descriptions, the "unpublished" badge), the **works list** and **contribute** pages (Spatial/Temporal status badges), and the **geoextent** tool (the seven "?" help icons, toolbar buttons, and per-result action buttons). The subscriptions page's hand-rolled CSS tooltip on the disabled "Save Changes" button was replaced with the same Bootstrap tooltip.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Accounts without an email were silently promoted to superuser when `OPTIMAP_SUPERUSER_EMAILS` was unset**: the setting parsed an unset/blank value into `[""]` instead of `[]`, so the `pre_save` promotion signal (connected in 0.26.0) matched every account whose email was blank (`"" in [""]`) and set `is_staff`/`is_superuser` on it. `OPTIMAP_SUPERUSER_EMAILS` now filters out empty entries (unset → `[]`), and the signal additionally ignores blank emails. This also fixes a CI test failure (`tests.test_statistics.test_now_forbidden_for_non_staff`) that surfaced the bug because the variable is unset in CI.

- **Crossref-prefix harvests silently truncated on transient empty pages**: a deep Crossref cursor crawl (e.g. Scientific Data, prefix 10.1038 — 8387 works) could stop hundreds of records short because the pagination loop treated the first empty `items` page — or a momentarily missing `next-cursor` — as definitive end-of-results. Crossref intermittently returns an empty page mid-walk under load, so the harvest ended early (observed: ~8000 of 8387) and still reported a clean `completed`. The loop now reads Crossref's `total-results`, retries the same cursor up to three times when a short page arrives, and logs a `stopped early: N of M records` **warning** (visible in the `HarvestingEvent` log and harvest summary email) if it still cannot reach the advertised total. Affects all `crossref-prefix` sources (Scientific Data, Copernicus, AGILE GIScience Series).

- **OGC API (`/ogcapi/`) database connection in non-Docker deployments**: the pygeoapi works collection now derives its PostgreSQL connection from Django's `DATABASE_URL` (the single source of truth) instead of a separate set of `OPTIMAP_DB_*` variables that no deployment actually set. Previously, plain deployments using `DATABASE_URL` would fail OpenAPI generation with `Resource not added to OpenAPI: Could not connect to … (password hidden)` and the `/ogcapi/collections/works/items` endpoint could not reach the database. The unused `OPTIMAP_DB_*` indirection is removed from `etc/pygeoapi-config.yml`, `etc/deploy-plain/env.example`, and the `docs/deployment-plain.md` backup script (now also driven by `DATABASE_URL`).

### Changed

- **Copernicus harvesting reframed from "Crossref fallback" to primary route**: the Copernicus OAI-PMH endpoint (`oai-pmh.copernicus.org/oai.php`) has been HTTP 404 since December 2025 with no recovery, so Crossref (DOI prefix 10.5194) is now documented and labelled as the established primary harvest route rather than a temporary fallback. The `copernicus` source is renamed from "Copernicus Publications (Crossref fallback)" to "Copernicus Publications". The disabled `essd` (Earth System Science Data) OAI-PMH source entry is removed from `SOURCE_CONFIG` — its content is reachable via `harvest_sources --source copernicus --source-title "Earth System Science Data"`. Docstrings and `docs/sources.md` / `docs/deployment-plain.md` examples updated to match. (The separate runtime fallback — using the Crossref-supplied abstract when a publisher landing-page fetch fails — is unchanged.)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **W3C Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices** (closes #161): OPTIMAP now follows the [W3C SDW-BP](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/) recommendations that are applicable to a non-linked-data publisher. Key changes: (1) GeoJSON coordinates are capped at **5 decimal places** (≈ 1.1 m at the equator) throughout — REST API responses, bulk GeoJSON/GeoPackage/CSV exports, schema.org JSON-LD on work landing pages, geo meta tags, and GeoRSS/Atom feeds — so coordinates no longer imply sub-centimetre accuracy that harvested metadata cannot support (BP 6 / BP 16); (2) GeoJSON responses now carry `Content-Type: application/geo+json` instead of `application/json` (BP 5); (3) work landing pages with geometry emit a `Link: rel="alternate"; type="application/geo+json"` HTTP header pointing to the REST API endpoint (BP 5); (4) the bulk GeoJSON download includes top-level `crs` and `coordinate_precision` fields (BP 15 / BP 16); (5) schema.org JSON-LD adds a `sameAs` link to the Wikidata item when the work has been exported to Wikidata (BP 3); (6) the API schema documents coordinate axis order and precision cap (BP 8). A compliance matrix is at [`docs/w3c-sdwbp-compliance.md`](docs/w3c-sdwbp-compliance.md).

- **Fallback Open Graph image for works without spatial extent** (closes #226): social link previews on Slack, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and similar platforms now always show an image. Works with geometry continue to use the map-preview PNG (1200×630); works not yet geocoded use a new static OPTIMAP-branded card (`works/static/img/og-fallback.png`). The homepage and regional feed pages also gain the fallback as their `og:image` / `twitter:image`.

- **Source statistics — OpenAlex, OAI-PMH, and Crossref works counts**: every harvest now fetches external works counts and stores them in a new `statistics` JSONField on `Source`. After each successful harvest: (1) if the source has an `openalex_id`, the total `works_count` is retrieved from the OpenAlex Sources API and stored as `openalex_works_count`; (2) if the source is OAI-PMH/OJS/Janeway, a single lightweight `ListIdentifiers` request retrieves the endpoint's `completeListSize` and stores it as `oai_works_count`; (3) if the source is `crossref-prefix` with a `doi_prefix`, a `rows=0` Crossref API request retrieves the total matching work count and stores it as `crossref_works_count` (optionally filtered by `source_titles` for broad-prefix journals like Scientific Data on 10.1038). All counts (with fetch dates) appear in the harvest summary printed by `harvest_sources`, in the HarvestingEvent log, in the Source admin list (three count columns with a stats filter), in the Collection admin list, and in the collection landing page admin section. A new `source_titles` field on `Source` stores the Crossref container-title filter list, auto-populated from `SOURCE_CONFIG`. `openalex_id` values are now configured for all journal sources that have a known OpenAlex entry (21 sources added). A new `docs/sources.md` documents all configured sources grouped by publisher.

- **AGILE Springer LNCS harvester** (closes #259): new `agile-gis-lncs` Crossref source harvests full-paper chapters from the 12 AGILE conference volumes published by Springer in the *Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography* series (2008–2019). Each book is fetched via a per-ISBN Crossref filter (`isbn:978-…`), driven by a new `harvest_crossref_book_list` task. The underlying `_build_crossref_filter` gains an `extra_filters` parameter for appending raw Crossref filter clauses. Chapters are harvested without spatial/temporal metadata (Springer landing pages carry none); geometry can be contributed by users via the existing contribution workflow. Both AGILE sources share the `agile-gis` key prefix, so `--source-prefix agile-gis` harvests both in one run.

- **Multiple time periods per publication** (closes #26): publications can now carry more than one time period. The contribution form on the work landing page shows all existing periods pre-populated in editable rows, and a new "Add time period" button lets users append further rows before submitting. Each period still uses the free-format date strings (`YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`) already accepted for single periods. The contribution endpoint accepts the new `temporal_extents` array payload from the frontend (the legacy single-object `temporal_extent` key is still supported for API clients and the georeferencing game). Display everywhere — work landing page, map popup, SEO meta tags, GeoRSS/Atom feeds — now shows all periods: the landing page and API render them semicolon-separated, the map popup shows up to two periods inline with a "(+N more ↗)" link when there are more.

### Changed

- **AGILE GIS collection renamed** (closes #259): the collection previously identified as `agile-giss` (URL `/collections/agile-giss/`) is renamed to `agile-gis` (URL `/collections/agile-gis/`) and its display name changed from "AGILE-GISS" to "AGILE GIS". Both the Copernicus (2020–present, `agile-giss`) and Springer LNCS (2008–2019, `agile-gis-lncs`) harvesters now target this single shared collection. The collection description is updated to explain both publishing streams. A data migration (`0019_rename_agile_collection`) handles existing deployments.

- **Collection logo** (closes #258): admins and curators can set an external logo URL on a collection. The logo is displayed as a thumbnail on the collection landing page (in the metadata line) and on the `/collections/` index cards. The field is also exposed via the REST API (`/api/v1/collections/`). Curators can set, update, or clear the logo via an inline edit form on the collection page — no file upload, external URL only.

### Fixed

- **Fix EarthArXiv OAI-PMH harvesting timeout**: the harvester now splits every harvest into per-calendar-year requests (`from`/`until`), starting with the most recent year and working backwards, so no single request asks the server for its full record history. Empty year ranges return `noRecordsMatch` and are skipped gracefully; existing records are skipped by the normal dedup logic. Sources whose stored URL already contains explicit `from=`/`until=` params are left unchanged (no chunking). The per-request timeout is also raised from 30 s to 90 s (configurable via `OPTIMAP_OAI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`).

- **Fix UI tests** (closes #142): remove module-level code in `test_loginconfirm.py` that crashed test discovery; remove stale `@unittest.skip` and duplicate nested class from `test_article_landing.py` and move it to `tests/` (the URL it targets has been implemented); fix three stale assertions broken by prior renames (feeds→regions, BoK URL, login response wording).

### Changed

- **Accessibility improvements across all pages** (closes #173). Template-level WCAG 2.1 fixes: `role="application"` and `aria-label` added statically to map containers (`<div id="map">`, `<div id="mini-map">`); `aria-modal="true"` and `aria-labelledby` added to both account-deletion modals in user settings; missing `<label for="email_new">` added to the change-email form; grouped region checkboxes on the subscriptions page now use semantic `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` instead of `<div>`; all data tables on the statistics page now have `scope="col"` on `<th>` elements; Chart.js canvas elements have `aria-label` and a visible text caption; decorative icons inside badges now carry `aria-hidden="true"`; dropdown dividers in the navigation menu are marked `aria-hidden="true"`; the generic "here" link in the About page is replaced with descriptive anchor text; the "accessibility" typo in about.html is fixed. Automated testing: `axe-selenium-python` added to dev dependencies; new `tests-ui/test_accessibility.py` runs axe-core scans on six public pages asserting zero critical/serious violations; new `tests/test_accessibility_html.py` adds fast Django-client assertions for the specific ARIA attributes introduced.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Add Ruff code formatter with enforcement via test suite and CI (#70). Configuration in `pyproject.toml` (line length 119, rules E/F/I). VSCode format-on-save via `.vscode/settings.json`; PyCharm via the Ruff plugin.

### Changed

- **EO4GEO BoK upgraded to `current` version (GeoSpaceBoK, 1,212 concepts)**. The default `OPTIMAP_BOK_VERSION` is now `current` instead of the pinned `v3` snapshot. The `current` version is served by [geospacebok.eu](https://geospacebok.eu) and adds 327 concepts compared to v3, including a heavily expanded GC3 AI/ML hierarchy (6 → 52 codes, e.g. `GC3-11-2` Space-time dynamic reasoning) and a new top-level `GN` category for GNSS concepts (~277 sub-codes). `OPTIMAP_BOK_CONCEPT_BASE_URL` default updated from `http://bok.eo4geo.eu` to `https://geospacebok.eu`; concept chips now link to `https://geospacebok.eu/<CODE>`. The `--version` flag on `refresh_bok_snapshot` has been renamed to `--bok-version` to avoid conflict with Django's built-in `--version` flag.

- **Richer `GET /api/v1/sources/` and `GET /api/v1/sources/<id>/` responses** (partial #247). Each source now includes `source_type`, `source_type_display`, `homepage_url`, `abbreviated_title`, `is_oa`, `is_preprint`, `source_url` (absolute API self-link), and `collection` (identifier + name + API URL of the default collection, or `null`). The endpoint is now `AllowAny` (was `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` — the data was already public). The embedded `source_details` block in Work API responses is updated to match.

- **Global data dumps (GeoJSON / GeoPackage / CSV) now include meaningful source and collection references** (partial #247). The raw integer `source` FK has been replaced with `source_name` (human-readable name) and `source_url` (absolute API endpoint for the source). A new `collections` field lists the collection identifiers each work belongs to. Internal fields that are meaningless to data consumers — `job`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `status`, `creationDate`, `lastUpdate`, `provenance`, `openalex_match_info`, `openalex_fulltext_origin`, `openalex_ids` — have been removed from the dump. GeoPackage and CSV are derived from the improved GeoJSON via `ogr2ogr` and pick up these changes automatically. **This is a breaking change** for existing consumers that rely on the removed columns or on `source` being an integer.

- **All outgoing emails now use file-based Django templates** (closes #110). Email bodies and subjects are stored in `works/templates/email/*.en.txt` — one file per email type (12 templates total). Subject lines are on the first line of each template; a blank line separates them from the body. Every subject now carries a `[OPTIMAP]` prefix and a relevant emoji. Autoescape is disabled for plain-text output so URLs are never HTML-encoded. Future language variants drop in as `*.de.txt` etc. with no code changes required. Missing content assertions for the magic-link, email-change, and account-deletion emails were added as part of this change.

- **Login, logout, and email-change flows now redirect to `/` with a flash message** instead of rendering dedicated single-alert pages. Removed `login_response.html`, `logout.html`, `changeuser.html`, and dead `deleteaccount.html` templates; removed corresponding dead `delete_account` view. Login and email-change messages use `extra_tags="persist"` so they stay visible until manually dismissed.
- **Per-message auto-close TTL for flash alerts.** Pass `extra_tags="persist"` to any `messages.*()` call to suppress auto-close entirely; `error` and `warning` level messages default to 8 s, `info`/`success` to 5 s (previously all server-rendered alerts shared a single 5 s timeout). `OPTIMAP_FLASH` JS alerts for `warning` now also get 8 s to match. The Bootstrap level tag (`alert-danger` etc.) is now derived from `message.level_tag` rather than the combined `message.tags` string, so `extra_tags` values no longer bleed into the CSS class.
- **Client-side geometry simplification for oversized polygons.** When an NER/gazetteer-suggested polygon exceeds the configurable warn threshold (default 50 KB), a simplification panel appears below the map instead of silently failing. The panel shows a logarithmic tolerance slider (0.01°–1°, covering ~1–111 km) with before/after point-count and size stats and a live Leaflet preview that updates as the slider moves. Three preset buttons (Light ~1 km / Medium ~11 km / Aggressive ~55 km) snap the slider to common values. At submit time, payloads above the hard limit (default 2 MB) are blocked and the panel is shown again. Both thresholds are server-configurable via `OPTIMAP_GEOMETRY_WARN_SIZE_KB` and `OPTIMAP_GEOMETRY_MAX_UPLOAD_KB`. Simplification uses Leaflet's built-in `L.LineUtil.simplify()` (Ramer–Douglas–Peucker) with no additional JS dependency.

### Added

- **Configurable notification intervals for regional subscriptions** (closes #85). Users can now choose between **weekly** (every Monday) and **monthly** (last day of month) email notifications on the subscriptions page. The selected interval is stored per subscription; existing subscribers default to monthly. Notifications now only include works published since the last successful notification, fixing a bug where the same papers were re-sent on every run.

- **Georeferencing game** (closes #14). A "Play" button in the top navbar and the burger menu sends users to `/contribute/next/`, which picks a random work still needing geolocation and redirects to its landing page in game mode. After each contribution, the page auto-advances to the next challenge instead of reloading. A game banner shows how many works have been georeferenced in the current session, with a "Skip to next" button. The NER location-suggestion panel opens and runs automatically in game mode so place suggestions are ready immediately. Game can be scoped to a single collection via `?collection=<identifier>`. A "Play georeferencing game" button also appears on `/contribute/` (and collection-filtered variants). Contributions made through the game are marked `game: true` in the work's provenance event log. A **"Play" button** is now shown next to the "Contribute metadata" button on collection landing pages, starting the georeferencing game scoped to that collection.

- **Chunked map loading with lazy popup details** (closes #256). The main map now loads works in configurable pages (default 1 000, `OPTIMAP_MAP_CHUNK_SIZE`) instead of one ~9 MB request; each chunk is rendered immediately so markers appear progressively. Initial chunks carry only geometry and minimal metadata (id, title, doi, status) via `?minimal=true`; full work details (abstract, source, OpenAlex fields) are fetched once from `GET /api/v1/works/<id>/` the first time a popup is opened and cached for the session. A loading indicator shows progress (`Loading works… N / M`). Both the single-feature popup and the paginated overlapping-works popup share the same lazy-load mechanism.

- **Link headers on paginated API responses** (RFC 5988). All paginated endpoints (`/api/v1/works/`, `/api/v1/sources/`, etc.) now emit a `Link:` response header with `rel="next"`, `rel="prev"`, `rel="first"`, and `rel="last"` URLs, following the same convention as the GitHub REST API.

- **`GET /api/v1/statistics/` — cached aggregate counts** (partial #160). Returns `published_works`, `total_works`, `total_works_for_user` (auth-aware: `published_works` for anonymous/non-staff, `total_works` for staff — matches what `/api/v1/works/` returns for the caller), `works_by_status` (per status code), `with_geometry`, `with_temporal`, `with_complete_metadata`, `complete_percentage`, `sources`, `collections`, `users`. Cached for 24 h. No authentication required; `works_by_status` is always included so harvested-work counts are public.

- **GeoScienceWorld as a new harvesting source type** (closes #251). A new `geoscienceworld` source type enumerates articles from Crossref by DOI prefix and extracts geographic coordinates from each article's GSW landing page via geoextent's built-in GeoScienceWorld content provider (which handles Cloudflare via `curl_cffi`). Three initial source configs are provided in `harvest_sources.py`: SEG (prefix `10.1190`), Geological Society of London (`10.1144`), and Mineralogical Society (`10.1180`). The `Source` model gains a new `doi_prefix` field used by both `crossref-prefix` and `geoscienceworld` harvesters, replacing the hardcoded `10.5194` Copernicus fallback in the Crossref harvester. Temporal/epoch extraction from GeoRef metadata is deferred pending [nuest/geoextent#122](https://github.com/nuest/geoextent/issues/122); tracked in #257.

- **Pagination on collection detail pages** (`/collections/<slug>/`). Collections with more than `OPTIMAP_PAGE_MAX_ITEMS` works (default 50) now show paginated work cards with configurable page size and first/prev/next/last navigation, replacing the previous hard cap of 100 with a static "showing first N" alert. A "Show only page on map" / "Show all on map" toggle button appears above the map; choosing "show all" fetches the full collection GeoJSON once and caches it in `sessionStorage` so subsequent page navigations are instant. Introduces a new `OPTIMAP_PAGE_MAX_ITEMS` setting (default 50) used by all paginated list views; the previous `OPTIMAP_WORKS_PAGE_SIZE_DEFAULT` remains as a fallback for backward compatibility. Pagination nav markup and the page-size dropdown are now shared via `_pagination.html` / `_pagination_nav.html` template includes, replacing duplicated blocks in `works.html` and `contribute.html`; the default page size (50) is now always present as a selectable option.

- **NER-based location suggestions on the work contribution form** (closes #199). A collapsible "Suggest locations from text" panel on the work landing page runs spaCy Named Entity Recognition on the work's title and abstract (two parallel API calls), looks up found place names via a configurable gazetteer (Nominatim by default), and presents the results as a selectable list. Matched spans are highlighted in the text preview using character offsets. Each place can be added to the Leaflet map individually or via "Add all to map". New REST endpoint: `POST /api/v1/geoextent/extract-text/` (see `docs/ner_location_suggestions.md`). Provenance events record `geometry_source` when NER-derived geometry is contributed. spaCy model auto-downloads on first use (~12 MB). Requires `geoextent>=0.13.0`.

- **REST API for collections at `/api/v1/collections/`**. `GET /api/v1/collections/` lists all published collections (paginated); `GET /api/v1/collections/<identifier>/` retrieves a single collection by its slug. Each response includes `works_count` (published works only), `collection_url`, and embedded `feeds` and `downloads` link objects. Staff can additionally retrieve unpublished collections. Documented in the OpenAPI schema under the *Collections* tag.

### Fixed

- **Privacy-policy consent is now explicitly recorded.** `UserProfile` gains a `consented_at` timestamp (nullable; `null` for accounts created before this change) that is stamped when a user clicks "I consent" on their first magic-link login. Previously consent was only implicit (account existence). A companion fix to `works/signals.py` makes the `UserProfile` auto-creation signal safe for legacy / admin-created accounts that have no profile row yet (`get_or_create` instead of a bare `instance.userprofile.save()` that would raise `RelatedObjectDoesNotExist`).

- **GeoJSON and GeoPackage downloads no longer emit bare `GeometryCollection` wrappers.** Django's `GeometryCollectionField` always serializes geometries as `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(…)`, even for single primitive shapes. This caused GeoPackage layers to be declared as `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`, which QGIS and other GIS tools cannot render with default symbology (layers appeared empty). The fix applies to every download endpoint: collection GeoJSON/GeoPackage (`/api/v1/collections/<slug>/download/{geojson,gpkg}/`), global GeoJSON (`/download/geojson/`), and global GeoPackage (`/download/geopackage/`). Single-member collections are unwrapped to the primitive type (`Point`, `Polygon`, etc.); same-type multi-member collections are promoted to `Multi*`; mixed-type collections are left as-is. GDAL format validation tests were added for all affected endpoints.

- **GeoRSS and Atom feeds for individual collections** (closes #248). Each published collection now has a GeoRSS feed at `/api/v1/feeds/collection-<slug>.rss` and an Atom feed at `/api/v1/feeds/collection-<slug>.atom`. Feed autodiscovery `<link>` tags are injected into the collection detail page `<head>`, and visible feed links appear in a new "Feeds & downloads" card on the page. Both URLs are listed in `sitemap-collection-feeds.xml`.

- **GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and CSV download endpoints for individual collections** (closes #217). Published collection works are downloadable at `/api/v1/collections/<slug>/download/geojson/`, `/gpkg/`, and `/csv/`. Results are cached for `FEED_CACHE_HOURS` (default 24 h); pass `?now` to force refresh. Download links appear in the new "Feeds & downloads" card on each collection page. All three endpoints are documented in the OpenAPI schema under the new *Collections* tag and indexed in `sitemap-collection-downloads.xml`.

- **31 additional Pensoft/ARPHA journals added as OAI-PMH sources.** All confirmed to embed `schema:contentLocation` GeoCoordinates JSON-LD (study-site points) in article pages. New source keys: `pensoft-zookeys`, `pensoft-phytokeys`, `pensoft-neobiota`, `pensoft-mycokeys`, `pensoft-herpetozoa`, `pensoft-natureconservation`, `pensoft-jhr`, `pensoft-alpineentomology`, `pensoft-subtbiol`, `pensoft-zse`, `pensoft-jor`, `pensoft-africaninvertebrates`, `pensoft-oneecosystem`, `pensoft-evolsyst`, `pensoft-dez`, `pensoft-mbmg`, `pensoft-neotropical`, `pensoft-zoologia`, `pensoft-biorisk`, `pensoft-caucasiana`, `pensoft-italianbotanist`, `pensoft-nl`, `pensoft-zitteliana`, `pensoft-abs`, `pensoft-saddi`, `pensoft-vdj`, `pensoft-anhmw`, `pensoft-aer`, `biosystecol`, `bulletinofinsectology`, `pensoft-nhcm`. Audit covered all 130 ARPHA OAI sets.
- **Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ) added as an OAI-PMH source** (`pensoft-bdj`, closes #92). Harvest with `python manage.py harvest_sources --source pensoft-bdj`. The ARPHA OAI-PMH endpoint is filtered to the `bdj` set so only BDJ records are fetched.
- **`extract_geometry_from_html()` now extracts `schema:contentLocation` GeoCoordinates from JSON-LD** (closes #92). Pensoft/ARPHA journals embed study-site coordinates via `contentLocation` rather than `spatialCoverage`; the new extraction step sits between `spatialCoverage` and the `geo+json` link in the priority chain and collects all points into a single `GeometryCollection`.

- **OGC API - Features endpoint at `/ogcapi/`** (closes #19). Published works are now accessible via a standards-compliant [OGC API - Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) interface powered by [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io/) and its PostgreSQL/PostGIS provider. Supports `bbox`, `datetime`, and `limit`/`offset` query parameters. Returns proper GeoJSON FeatureCollections with `numberMatched` / `numberReturned` / pagination links. Only published works (`status='p'`) are served, via a dedicated `works_published` database view. Configuration in `etc/pygeoapi-config.yml`; generate the required OpenAPI document with `python manage.py generate_pygeoapi_openapi`. Client demo code for Python (`requests` + `geopandas` + `folium`), R (`sf` + `mapview`), and QGIS (GUI and PyQGIS console) in `docs/ogcapi-clients.md`.

- **Weekly inactivity warning email to users** (closes #120). Users who have not logged in for 12–13 months receive a warning that their account will be deleted if they do not log in within 30 days. The email explains what happens to their data (credentials removed; contributions remain but become anonymous; recognition board entry removed). Scheduled automatically via Django-Q every Monday.

- **Weekly deletion list for admins** (closes #121). Users inactive for over 13 months are reported in a weekly email to all staff users with an email address. The list includes each user's email, last-login date, and join date, with a link to the Django admin. If no users are pending deletion, no email is sent.

- **Sentinel "Deleted User" account for de-identified contributions.** When any user account is deleted, their contributions (spatial/temporal/ontology metadata on publications) are reassigned to a permanent `username="deleted"` sentinel account rather than set to `NULL`. This preserves contributed metadata in the admin UI with a clear "Deleted User" label instead of a blank. The sentinel is created automatically on each `migrate` run via a `post_migrate` signal and is accessible via `CustomUser.deleted_user()`. A `pre_delete` signal on `CustomUser` handles the reassignment for both user-initiated and admin-initiated deletions.

- **Inline curator management on collection pages** (closes #234). Admins and existing curators can add curators by email address and remove them directly from the collection landing page. When the curator list changes, all current curators, all admins, the actor, and the added/removed curator receive a notification email. The former Django Admin "Manage curators" link has been replaced by this in-page UI.

- **Admin notification on new user registration.** When a brand-new account is persisted (i.e. a magic-link recipient completes the second "confirm" step of the new-account flow), every `is_staff` user with an email address receives a notification with the new user's email and a link to the admin user page. Sent asynchronously via Django-Q and logged in `EmailLog` (`trigger_source="scheduled"`). The send failure path never blocks login.
- **Automatic BoK concept extraction from AGILE GISS PDFs** (closes #250). The Crossref harvester downloads the full-text PDF for each newly ingested AGILE GIScience Series paper and parses the "BoK Concepts" section. Three section formats are handled: bracketed codes (`[TA12-6]`), arrow-separated names (`concept → sub-concept`), and comma/semicolon-separated names. Extracted codes are validated against the cached BoK snapshot and stored in `Work.bok_concepts`; status stays `h` (machine action, not a human contribution). Provenance carries a `bok_pdf_extract` event recording the PDF URL and codes found. A new `python manage.py extract_agile_bok [--limit N] [--throttle SECONDS] [--force] [--dry-run]` command backfills the already-harvested corpus. The `agile-giss-openalex` predefined source is removed in favour of the authoritative Crossref route.

- **Tag works with EO4GEO Body of Knowledge concepts** (closes #245). New `bok_concepts` field on `Work` plus an autosuggest combobox on the work landing page (≥3-character query, full keyboard, multi-select) backed by `GET /api/v1/bok/search/`. Tagged concepts render as chips that link to the canonical concept page on [geospacebok.eu](https://geospacebok.eu), surface in the public Work API as `bok_concepts` / `bok_concepts_resolved`, and emit JSON-LD `about: [DefinedTerm,…]` on the landing page. Adding the first concept on a harvested work flips its status from Harvested to Contributed for admin review; Recognition Board credit is recorded under a new generic *Ontology contributions* kind (so the same bucket can later cover other controlled vocabularies) and deduped per (user, work) so the same user adding more concepts later does not double-count. The cached BoK snapshot is refreshed by `python manage.py refresh_bok_snapshot` (configurable via `OPTIMAP_BOK_VERSION`). The editor is **opt-in**: set `OPTIMAP_BOK_ENABLED_COLLECTIONS` to a comma-separated list of `Collection.identifier` slugs to enable it on works in those collections — empty (default) disables the editor site-wide. Read-only chips on already-tagged works remain visible regardless.

### Changed

- **Contribution editor open to logged-in users on both Harvested *and* Contributed works** so a second contributor can fill a different gap (e.g. add temporal extent after someone else added a geometry). Pre-existing extents no longer close the form: user B may replace user A's geometry, with the provenance log recording attribution.
- **Recognition Board credit dedupes per (user, work, kind) via the provenance log.** Re-editing the same property type on the same work counts once for that user; different users editing the same property each count separately. Applies to spatial, temporal, and the new ontology bucket.

- **Filter the contribute page by collection** with `/contribute/?collection=<identifier|id|short_slug>`; collection landing pages link into it.

- **Copy/paste geometries between the geoextent tool and the contribution form.** A new "Copy extents" button on `/geoextent/` saves all extracted geometries to the browser; a "Paste geoextents" button on the work landing page (when contributing spatial extent) pastes them into the map as editable layers ready to submit.

- **Admin-only "Publish all unpublished works" button on collection pages** — bulk-flips every Harvested or Contributed work in the collection to Published in one click. Curators see no button (admins-only). Draft / Testing / Withdrawn works are deliberately left untouched.

- **Mountain Wetlands and OpenAlex-as-source harvesters now auto-create a Collection** for the source on first run (mirroring the OAI-PMH path from issue #192). New collections start unpublished so admins can review name/description before exposing them on `/collections/`.

- **Separate "Unpublished works" map layer** for admins (main map) and collection curators (collection pages). Features split into two togglable layers, *Published works (N)* and *Unpublished works (N)* (dashed, muted). Popups for unpublished features show a status badge.

- **Publication status badge in all map popups.** Every popup (single-click and paginated) now shows a colour-coded status badge (green Published / teal Harvested / blue Contributed / etc.) in the header. Unpublished works also carry a "not visible to anonymous users" note. When paging through a cluster of overlapping geometries, the badge updates with each page so admins and curators can tell published from unpublished works at a glance.

- **Spatial and temporal extent indicators on work cards.** Collection pages (curators/admins), the Contribute listing, and the Works list now show green *Spatial* / *Temporal* badges on each work card when logged in — green if extent data is present, grey if absent — making data-completeness gaps visible at a glance without opening each work.

- **Point geometries on the main map now render as circle markers** (radius 6 px, same style as the work landing page) instead of the default Leaflet pin icons. Hover, click, and paginated-popup interaction all continue to work.

- **Work-state-change email notifications** — admins and collection curators receive an email when a user contributes spatial or temporal metadata; contributors receive an email when their work is later published. Per-user opt-out toggle on `/usersettings/`.

- **CSV download with WKT geometry column** (closes #206) — published works are exported as CSV at `/download/csv/` alongside GeoJSON and GeoPackage. New `python manage.py regenerate_data_dumps [--format geojson|gpkg|csv] [--dry-run]` command for synchronous on-demand regeneration.

- **Reverse-geocoded placename and country code on work landing pages**, with a tooltip noting Nominatim as the source. Per-point matches with permalinks to OSM are recorded under `Work.provenance.geocoding` for admins.

- **OpenAlex-as-source harvester** (`source_type='openalex'`) — uses OpenAlex itself as the harvest origin, configured with an OpenAlex Source identifier. New `python manage.py compare_agile_giss_routes` command diffs the OpenAlex and Crossref routes side-by-side.

- **Crossref harvester now extracts authors and biblio fields** (`volume`, `issue`, `first_page`, `last_page`).

- **Reverse-geocoded `placename` and `country_code` on the Work API** — both keys always emitted (null when absent).

- **Collection backlinks on work landing pages** — each work landing page lists the collections it belongs to; unpublished collections shown only to admins.

- **Inline curator-editable collection description** — curators (and admins) edit a collection's description directly on `/collections/<identifier>/`. Plain text only.

- **Admin-only "Manage curators" deep-link on the collection page** — one-click jump to the admin change form anchored on the curators field.

### Fixed

- **Returning users with mixed-case emails no longer see the consent screen or crash on login.** Email addresses are now normalised to lowercase at intake (`loginres`, `change_useremail`, `EmailChangeSerializer`) so the DB always stores lowercase values. The `?confirmed=true` branch uses `get_or_create` instead of `create_user` as a race-condition guard. Migration `0009` back-fills `LOWER()` on all existing `CustomUser.email`, `CustomUser.username`, and `BlockedEmail.email` rows; user lookups revert to exact `=` matches so the B-tree index is used again.

- **Admin "Trigger / Schedule / Retry harvesting" actions and `harvest_journals` now dispatch by `source_type`** instead of hardcoding the OAI task, so non-OAI sources (MaRESS, RSS, Crossref, OpenAlex) run the right harvester. `harvest_journals` also reconciles stale Source rows against `SOURCE_CONFIG` (rewrites `source_type`, fills blank soft fields, preserves admin edits).

- **Inline mutation buttons reflect the new state immediately on production.** Authenticated responses on `/collections/`, the work landing page, and `/subscriptions/` are no longer captured by the site-wide cache, so publish/unpublish/contribute/subscribe state flips on reload. Anonymous responses still cached.

- **"View work details" button now appears in single-feature popups for works without a DOI.**

- **Empty-DOI backfill on re-harvest** — works ingested without a DOI have it filled when a later harvest delivers one. `python manage.py backfill_openalex` also recovers DOIs via OpenAlex matches.

- **Collections entry restored to the burger menu**, and **collection-page work cards always link to the OPTIMAP landing page** rather than to an external URL.

### Changed

- **Mountain Wetlands harvester simplified now that MaRESS exposes DOIs** (closes #244). The harvester reads DOIs directly from the API (normalising `https://doi.org/…` → bare `10.x/y`). When the API already supplies both a DOI *and* authors, OpenAlex is skipped entirely — no extra metadata to recover and no wasted rate-limit budget. Records missing a DOI or authors fall back to the OpenAlex title+author path. `Work.provenance.openalex_match.status` gains a `skipped` value for the fast path.

- **`/collections/` work counts** show only published works to regular users; admins and curators of a collection get a per-status breakdown (zero-count rows hidden).

- **Data-dump regeneration unified into one umbrella task.** GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and CSV are produced from one intermediate. Retention now keeps the newest N timestamp groups rather than raw files.

- **HTML geotagging meta tags + spec-compliant schema.org `Place.geo` on work landing pages** (closes #222) — landing pages emit `geo.position`, `ICBM`, and (when available) `geo.placename` / `geo.region`. `ScholarlyArticle.spatialCoverage.geo` now follows [schema.org/geo](https://schema.org/geo): point geometries become `GeoCoordinates`, others become `GeoShape` with a `box`. Multi-point geometries reduced to the lowest common ancestor in the address hierarchy.

- **In-memory cache for hot anonymous reads** (closes #180, partially #7) — adds a `LocMemCache` alias for static / low-change anonymous pages (privacy, about, accessibility, feeds list, sitemap, robots.txt) and the work landing page. Responses advertise their TTL via `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers. Authenticated/staff requests always render live.

- **Zotero / reference-manager metadata on work landing pages** (issue #243) — emits `citation_abstract` (full text), `citation_publisher`, `citation_language`, repeated `citation_keywords`, `citation_volume`/`issue`/`firstpage`/`lastpage`, and `citation_pdf_url`. Collection card pages also carry a COinS fallback for multi-item save.

- **Squashed Django migrations into a single `0001_initial`** in preparation for a clean redeployment.

### Added

- **`Work.placename` + `Work.country_code` populated by reverse geocoding** (issue #222). Gated by `OPTIMAP_GEOCODE_WORKS_ON_SAVE` (off by default). New `python manage.py backfill_placenames [--limit N] [--force] [--sleep 1.1] [--dry-run]` command.

- **OAI-PMH harvester auto-creates a Collection per endpoint** (closes #192) — the first harvest of an OAI/OJS/Janeway source creates a `Collection` and links it. New collections start `is_published=False`.

- **`HarvestingEvent.records_updated` counter** — every harvester tracks updated works separately from created ones, surfaced in the admin and the completion email.

- **Per-source dedup and careful-update flag in every harvester** — duplicate detection scoped to `Source`. New `--update` flag on `harvest_journals` (and `update_existing=True`) refreshes existing same-source works in place; user-contributed spatial/temporal metadata, `status`, and `created_by` are preserved.

- **Mountain Wetlands Repository harvester** (issue #192) — manual-only; run via `python manage.py harvest_journals --journal mountain-wetlands`.

- **Collections** (issue #192, foundation) — new `Collection` model groups works under a curated identifier. Routes: `/collections/`, `/collections/<identifier>/`. Curators add/remove works on the work landing page; admins publish/unpublish from either page. Includes a collection sitemap and burger-menu entry.

- **`Source.source_type` choice field** (`oai-pmh` / `ojs` / `janeway` / `rss` / `crossref-prefix` / `mountain-wetlands`) — replaces the implicit OAI-PMH assumption. Default `harvest_interval_minutes` flips to `0` (manual-only).

- **`Source.collection` foreign key** replaces the legacy `collection_name` string field.

- **Structured `Work.provenance` (JSONField)** with a defined schema (`harvest`, `metadata_sources`, `openalex_match`, `events`). User contributions and admin publish/unpublish actions append to `events`.

### Fixed

- **Crossref-prefix harvester no longer auto-publishes harvested works** — new works default to Harvested, not Published.

- **Work landing page hides the empty map when no geometry is available.** Shows a "no geospatial metadata" notice with a link to the contribution page instead.

- **`Source.save()` no longer queues every source to fire immediately, and no longer resets the schedule on unrelated edits.** New schedules use `now() + harvest_interval_minutes`; the schedule row is preserved when the interval is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Harvesting code split into the `works.harvesting` package** — one module per concern (OAI-PMH, RSS, Crossref, Mountain Wetlands, OpenAlex, sessions, helpers). Existing dotted-path imports (`works.tasks.harvest_*`) continue to resolve.

- **Database indices on hot `Work` query paths** (issue #141) — adds `status`, `(-creationDate, -id)`, `publicationDate`, and a partial `(-creationDate, -id) WHERE status='p'`.

- **HTTP `Referrer-Policy` is now `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`** so the OpenStreetMap tile server stops blocking map requests.

- **OAI-PMH harvester hardened against transient and content-type errors** — sessions get retries (3 attempts, exponential back-off), 30 s timeout, and a User-Agent. Non-XML 200 responses are rejected with a body preview.

### Added

- **`reset_harvest_schedules` management command** — rebuilds every `Harvest Source <id>` schedule with a deferred `next_run`, staggered. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--no-stagger`, `--clear-manual`.

- **`harvest_journals --insert-sources`** — bulk-creates `Source` rows for every entry in `SOURCE_CONFIG` without harvesting. `--include-disabled` opts in disabled journals.

- **Admin UI for harvesting management and log exploration** (issue #228) — `Source` is registered at `/admin/works/source/` with three actions ("Trigger harvesting", "Trigger harvesting for all", "Schedule harvesting"). `HarvestingEvent` admin shows record counts, error message, log block, and a "Retry" action; recent events appear inline on each `Source`.

- **Profanity filter on Recognition Board usernames** — submitted display names are checked against [`better-profanity`](https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/)'s default list.

- **Flash messages are now visible on every page** — queued Django messages render as dismissible Bootstrap alerts in `base.html`.

- **Contributor Recognition Board** (issue #240) — public `/recognition-board/` page ranking users who contributed spatial or temporal metadata. Five explorer-named tiers (Marco Polo → Roald Amundsen) on a logarithmic scale (1 / 10 / 100 / 1000 / 10000). Opt-in display name set under Settings → Recognition Board.

- **Minimal SEO surface on landing pages** (issue #22) — work landing pages emit Open Graph, Twitter Card, schema.org `ScholarlyArticle` JSON-LD, and Google Scholar `citation_*` tags. Homepage emits `WebSite` + `SearchAction`; regional feeds emit `CollectionPage`. `<link rel="canonical">` on every SEO-relevant page.

- **Open Graph preview images for work landing pages** (issue #22) — `/work/<id>/preview.png` renders a 1200×630 PNG of the work's spatial extent on an OSM basemap. Disk-cached, invalidated on save.

- **`.zenodo.json` deposit metadata** (issue #16) — repository-root metadata file so GitHub releases archived to Zenodo are populated with title, description, creators, license, and links.

<!-- REUSE-IgnoreStart -->
- **REUSE / SPDX license headers on all source files** (issue #30) — every first-party file carries SPDX headers; `REUSE.toml` covers fixtures and vendored assets. Run `reuse lint` to verify.
<!-- REUSE-IgnoreEnd -->

- **Janeway harvesting and `janeway_geometadata` plugin support** (issues #15, #18) — OAI-PMH harvesting picks up geometries published by Janeway journals running [`janeway_geometadata`](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/janeway_geometadata). Extraction priority: schema.org JSON-LD → `<link rel="alternate" type="application/geo+json">` → `DC.SpatialCoverage` → `DC.box`.

- **ISO 8601 open intervals** in `DC.temporal` and JSON-LD `temporalCoverage` are parsed correctly: `../2024-12-31` produces `(None, "2024-12-31")`. Single instants stored as `(value, value)`.

- **Geoextent API** — REST endpoints exposing the [geoextent library](https://github.com/nuest/geoextent):
  - `/api/v1/geoextent/extract/` — extract from uploaded files (GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, Shapefile, GeoPackage, KML, CSV, etc.)
  - `/api/v1/geoextent/extract-remote/` — extract from remote repositories (Zenodo, PANGAEA, OSF, Figshare, Dryad, GFZ, Dataverse)
  - `/api/v1/geoextent/extract-batch/` — batch processing
  - Response formats: GeoJSON (default), WKT, WKB. Optional placename via Nominatim / GeoNames / Photon.

- **Geoextent web interface** — interactive tool at `/geoextent/` for file upload, remote extraction by DOI/URL, Leaflet preview, parameter customisation, and result download.

- **Feeds sitemap** — `/sitemap-feeds.xml` listing all regional feeds.

- **Wikidata export** — export work metadata to a Wikibase/Wikidata instance, including extreme points and geometric centre. Configured via `WIKIBASE_*` environment variables.

- **Global regions layer** — toggleable map overlay showing continent and ocean boundaries; click for region details and regional feed.

- **Zoom-to-all features control** — quick-fit button on every map.

- **Geocoding/gazetteer search** — search-by-location on map (Nominatim default; GeoNames optional).

- **Works list with pagination** — `/works/list/` browse page with configurable page size.

- **Regional subscription system** — subscribe to email notifications for new works in selected continents/oceans.

- **Temporal extent contribution** — users contribute temporal extent (start/end dates) alongside or instead of spatial extent. Accepts `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`.

- **Status workflow documentation** — all 6 publication statuses (Draft, Harvested, Contributed, Published, Testing, Withdrawn) documented in README with transitions and visibility rules.

- **Burger menu navigation** — top-bar hamburger menu with links to all main pages.

- **Human-readable sitemap** — `/pages` lists all pages with descriptions, organised by category.

- **Custom error pages** — styled 404 and 500 pages matching the application design.

- **"View work details" button on map popups** linking to the work landing page.

- **Paginated popup for overlapping features** — Previous/Next navigation when multiple works overlap.

- **Point geometry highlighting** — circle markers show visual feedback when selected (gold/orange).

- **Admin unpublish action** — admins can unpublish a work, changing status from Published to Draft.

- **RSS/Atom feed harvesting support** alongside OAI-PMH.

- **`harvest_journals` management command** — CLI tool for harvesting from real journal sources with progress reporting.

- **Test coverage** — 40+ tests covering temporal contribution, status workflow, RSS harvesting, and live journal harvesting.

### Changed

- **Contribution page pagination** — `/contribute/` paginates with configurable page size (default 50, max 200).

- **Model terminology alignment** — `Publication` renamed to `Work` throughout. API endpoint changes from `/api/v1/publications/` to `/api/v1/works/`, sitemap to `/sitemap-works.xml`, URL pattern to `/work/<id>/`. Django app renamed from `publications/` to `works/`.

- **Work type taxonomy** — `type` field added with 39 work types (Crossref/OpenAlex vocabulary). Set from source's `default_work_type`; overridden by OpenAlex when available.

- **Removed external CDN dependencies** — all JS and CSS libraries served locally.

- **Improved map accessibility** — keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

- **Regional subscription email notifications** — emails group works by region; each section shows region name, type, count, and a link.

- **Unified contribution workflow** — single "Submit contribution" button covers spatial and/or temporal extent in one action.

- **Unified admin control panel** — admin status, publish/unpublish, provenance, and "Edit in Admin" consolidated into one box at the top of the work landing page.

- **Improved text wrapping** — page titles and abstracts wrap on narrow windows.

- **Unified URL structure** — ID-based URLs changed from `/publication/<id>/` to `/work/<id>/`.

- **Consolidated work identifier logic** — new `Work.get_identifier()` returns the DOI when available, falling back to the internal ID.

- **Refactored `views_geometry.py`** — DOI-based functions wrap ID-based functions; ~36 % reduction.

- **Renamed "Locate" to "Contribute"** — URL, page title, and navigation updated.

- **Contribute page layout refactored** — text overflow fixed.

- **Flexible publishing requirements** — harvested works with geometry can be published directly without requiring user contribution.

- **Contribute page login button improved** — informational disabled button: "Please log in to contribute (user menu at top right)".

- **Simplified footer navigation** — Sitemap, About/Contact/Imprint, Privacy, and data license only. Other links moved to burger menu and sitemap.

### Fixed

- **JavaScript scope error** — `drawnItems is not defined` on the contribution form.

- **GeoJSON geometry detection** — map click detection now reads `layer.feature.geometry` directly, with point-in-polygon (ray casting), point-on-line, and point detection.

- **Map popup null location error** — paginated popup no longer crashes; existing popup is closed before setting a new location.

- **Highlight persistence after popup close** — geometries return to default style when popups close.

- **Individual popups during pagination** — individual feature popups no longer open simultaneously with the paginated popup.

- **Close button highlight clearing** — popup close (X) and ESC clear geometry highlights.

- **First-page highlight race condition** in the paginated popup.

- **CircleMarker style properties** — point geometries use `radius` instead of `dashArray` for proper visual feedback.
